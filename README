Chrome extension that allows easy transfer of text and media from Chrome to Glass

Overview
--------
This extension was built by assembling pieces of 3 projects released by Google
as example code:
  * The oauth_contacts Chrome Extension (http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/extensions/oauth_contacts/)
  * The ChromeToPhone Chrome Extension (https://code.google.com/p/chrometophone/source/browse/)
  * The Mirror API QuickStart for Java (https://github.com/googleglass/mirror-quickstart-java)

Architecture
------------
The App Engine component (deployed at https://chrome2glass.appspot.com/) is little more than a
version of the QuickStart for Java with a few key differences:
 * Authentication has been tweaked to support access via OAuth from the extension
 * The UI has been stripped down to hide features not exposed by the extension
 * The deployed version contains a private key for Mirror API access

The extension authenticates to the App Engine server using OAuth for Installed Applications
(http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuthForInstalledApps.html). This is distinct from
the OAuth authentication performed by the App Engine server to perform "offline" access on the
user's behalf to send content to the Mirror API. Both authententication flows are required for
the extension to work correctly.

Usage
-----
Step 1: Navigate to https://chrome2glass.appspot.com/ and complete the sign in flow to delegate
access to your timeline.
Step 2: Install the browser extension from the Chrome Web Store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome2glass/khdaampnoedgchmgickhmdfiffedldij)
Step 3: Click on the extension's icon to sign in; note that you don't have to authorize the
extension to access your timeline, that is handled on the server.
Step 4: Right click on links, media or text selections to get a context menu that sends content
to your Glass

When signed in, clicking on the extension's icon opens a tab where you can see the last
few items sent to Glass using this extension. It also allows you to sign out.
